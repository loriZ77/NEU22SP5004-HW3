     * ------------
     * Given an array of words, return the array after trimming each word.
     * For the i-th word, the trimming rules are:
     *   * Rule 1: If the length of the word is smaller than or equal to i, or the word is "lololol", then you don't have to trim it.
     *   * Rule 2: Compare the first letter and the last letter of the word, remove the smaller one from the word. 
     *             If these two letters are the same, then remove the first one.
     *             Keep doing this until the word meets rule 1.
     * ------------
     * Example 1:
     *   Input: words = ["a", "cdm", "lololol", "asd", "ooooooooooo"]
     *   Output: ["a", "dm", "lololol", "asd", "ooooo"]
     * Example 2:
     *   Input: words = []
     *   Output: []
     * Example 3:
     *   Input: words = [""]
     *   Output: [""]
     * ------------
     * Constraints:
     *   * 0 <= words.length <= 50
     *   * 0 <= words[i].length <= 100
     *   * words[i] only contains lowercase English letters
     * 
     * @param words target array of words
     * @return array of words after trimming
